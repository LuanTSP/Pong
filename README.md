This project uses raylib as the graphics library. So we need to install its dependencies first:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Install [raylib](https://github.com/LuanTSP/Pong.git).
3. Build the program
   cd into Pong and run:

##

      g++ -Wall -Wextra -g3 -l raylib main.cpp -o pong
      ./pong

The game should start.
